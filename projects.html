        This was a fun project. I made this game in LOVE2D with just a little help from a friend to get started
        (the same friend also composed the music) and i think the end result is great. Massively inspired by
        Super hexagon and quite functional (and finished too! Not very many projects get that privilege). Definitely
        one of my prouder accomplishments.

        In the spring of 2018 i participated in the Global Game Jam on the a which made Laborinth, which
         I would by no means call a masterpiece, there was a lot of polish missing in the end, but I had
         a very enjoyable time nonetheless. In this project I was in charge of 3D modelling and level design.

        I have a soundcloud channel too. When I make music I actually find worth listening to I upload it here.
         I don't make music often, as you can surely see, but sometimes I do get a bit of auditory creativity too.

        I also have a YouTube channel where I post any video projects I do. Past projects include some animation
        learning in Source Filmmaker as well as a etsplay series. Not much else worth mentioning, as of yet.

        This website, too, is also one of my works. Wuldn't make much sense not to write my own project showoff
         website, seeing as I can. Written in CSS and HTML, with the background image madein GIMP, this website
         was only slightly made for a school project, and only slightly caused me to stay up til 6AM to finish it
         within the deadline.
