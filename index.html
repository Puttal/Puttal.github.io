      And welcome to CloudHater's Project Database! <br><br>

      Here you may find some of the things I've worked on in my years of creating things digitally.
      The site has been divided into four pages for your reading pleasure. I'd suggest starting with the Bio
      for an introduction and then looking at the Projects and Images pages. <br><br>

      Over on the Projects page are some of my personal picks of possibly intresting projects
      I've worked on (with pictures! and text!). <br><br>

      On the Images page you may find a gallery of random images and some explanation as to what they are.
      (to see the explanations just hover over the pictures) <br><br>

      And finally there's the Bio page (which I suggest you read first). The bio page is a quick introduction to
      who I am and what I do. <br><br>

      Please do enjoy your stay <br>
      -CloudHater
