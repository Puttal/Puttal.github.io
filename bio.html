      Hi! <br><br>

      I'm CloudHater, a denizen of the internet with an intrest in a lot of different things,
      including videogames, sci-fi, fantasy, and science fantasy. <br><br>

      On this site you may find the products of my endeavors into many of my other intrests, such as programming,
      digital art, physical art, game design, designing things in games, and many more. Many of these projects were
      done in my spare time and some also with friends. <br><br>

      In my not-spare (I don't care if that's not a word, I'm using it)
      time I'm a full time student at an upper secondary school with an itrerest in science and my sights set for
      engineering, though I also enjoy having art classes on the side. <br><br>

      While many of the things here aren't of very high quality, but I still feel that they are important to
      me, both as opportunities for learning and as things to look back at to see my own progress. I believe
      that being open is important, and that belief also carries over to this site. While some of these works may
      be better off forgotten, I'm still proud of them, as having made trash is better than having made nothing. <br><br>

      If you'd like to contact me for whatever reason my primary form of
      communication is Discord(id: CloudHater#1708). Other than that you could try to message me through
      YouTube or Soundcloud (links in the projects page). <br><br>

      Enjoy your stay! <br>
      -CloudHater
